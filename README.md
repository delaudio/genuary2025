# Genuary 2025

Daily creative coding sketches for Genuary 2025, organized in separate projects based on the video export technology used.

## About

This repository contains my submissions for [Genuary 2025](https://genuary.art/), a month-long creative coding challenge. The projects are split into two main folders based on their video export approach:

```
/remotion    # Projects using Remotion for video export
/puppeteer   # Projects using Puppeteer for video export
```

Each approach was chosen based on specific project requirements:
- Remotion: For projects needing precise frame control and React integration
- Puppeteer: For projects requiring browser-specific features or real-time animation capture

## Setup

Both project folders have their own dependencies and setup:

### Remotion Projects

```bash
cd remotion
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Puppeteer Projects

```bash
cd puppeteer
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Technology Stack

### Remotion Projects
- P5.js for creative coding
- React for component architecture
- Remotion for high-quality video export

### Puppeteer Projects
- P5.js for creative coding
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Puppeteer for browser automation and video capture
